  <h1>About</h1>

  <p class="lead">Welcome to the IAGD’s digital resource collection of tactile graphics for geoscience education.</p>

  <h2>Why this resource collection?</h2>
  <div class='my-4'>
    <div class='row'>
      <div class='col-md-6'>
        Geology is a visually-stimulating science that presents significant challenges to students with visual disabilities and their instructors.  Too often, instructors of low-vision students have to create their own tactile graphics, and this usually requires a significant investment of time and effort.  This digital resource collection was designed to supply instructors with ready-made graphics that can be rapidly converted to tactile graphics using technology commonly available at their institution’s disability office.  We hope it is helpful to you!

  <h2>Who can use this resource collection?</h2>
  <div class='my-4'>
    This digital resource collection is freely available for the use of geoscience educators at high schools, colleges, and universities who need quick and easy access to tactile graphics illustrating a range of topics covered in introductory geoscience courses.
  </div>

  <h2>What information is included in this resource collection?</h2>
  <div class='my-4'>
    Each image in the collection is included as a PowerPoint (.pptx) file which can be modified for customized use and as an Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) file which cannot be as easily modified.  Each of these files contains three pages:
    <ol>
      <li>
        The graphic with accompanying text and labels in English
      </li>
      <li>
        The graphic with accompanying text and labels in Grade 2 (contracted) 24 point Braille
      </li>
      <li>
        The graphic with no accompanying text or labels
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="/assets/images/fig1.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Graphic with text and labels in English">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Graphic with text and labels in English</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="/assets/images/fig2.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Graphic with accompanying text and labels in Grade 2 (contracted) 24 point Braille">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Graphic with accompanying text and labels in Grade 2 (contracted) 24 point Braille</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="/assets/images/fig3.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Graphic with no accompanying text or labels">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Graphic with no accompanying text or labels</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Is the collection searchable?</h2>
  <div class='my-4'>
    Yes.  In addition to searching by text, the collection is also organized by topic (e.g., “Minerals”, “Igneous materials and processes”, “Plate Tectonics”, etc.).  Thumbnail images are also included for each file to allow easy browsing and visual search.    
  </div>

  <h2>What equipment is required to edit, print, and use these tactile images?</h2>
  <div class='my-4'>
    <h3>Editing the images</h3>
    <div class='my-2'>
      To edit the ppt images in this resource collection, the following resources will be useful:
      <ul>
        <li>
          an online Braille translator, such as <a href="https://www.brailletranslator.org">https://www.brailletranslator.org</a> or <a href="https://www.branah.com/braille-translator">https://www.branah.com/braille-translator</a>.  We recommend Grade 2 (contractional Braille). 
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.tsbvi.edu/download-braille-and-asl-specialty-fonts">Swell Braille font</a> is the recommended font for tactile graphics produced by the method described below.    
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Printing the images as tactile graphics</h3>
    <div class='my-2 row'>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          The images in this resource collection must be printed out on <strong>thermal capsule (or “swell”) paper</strong> (8.5 x 11 sized paper is the best size for the images in this database).  Your institution’s disability office may have capsule paper available to use, but if they do not, here are a few vendors:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="http://piaf-tactile.com/tangible-magic-paper/">http://piaf-tactile.com/tangible-magic-paper/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://www.americanthermoform.com/product/swell-touch-paper/">http://www.americanthermoform.com/product/swell-touch-paper/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://store.humanware.com/hus/tangible-magic-capsule-paper-8-in-x-11-in-100-sheets-package.html">https://store.humanware.com/hus/tangible-magic-capsule-paper-8-in-x-11-in-100-sheets-package.html</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.enablemart.com/swell-touch-paper">https://www.enablemart.com/swell-touch-paper</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.maxiaids.com/swell-touch-paper-85-x-11-in-100-sheets">https://www.maxiaids.com/swell-touch-paper-85-x-11-in-100-sheets</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The graphic must first be printed directly on the swell paper before it is passed through the PIAF machine.  Dark areas containing carbon are activated by heat within the PIAF machine and expand producing a raised area on the paper.  In our experience, images printed with toner-based laser printers produce a much better result with the PIAF than those produced with inkjet printers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, the thermal capsule paper with the image on it must be passed through a machine that heats the paper to produce the raised relief.  Again, your institution’s disability office may already have one, but if they do not, here are some vendors:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="http://piaf-tactile.com">HARPO PIAF (“Pictures in a Flash”) printer</a> and <a href="http://piaf-tactile.com/docs/PIAF_User_Guide_and_Workbook_EN.pdf">manual</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://www.woodlaketechnologies.com/category-s/1884.htm">Swell-Form Graphics II Machine</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img alt="Tectonic plate map being printed on a Pictures in a Flash printer" class="rounded img-fluid" src="{{ "/assets/images/piaf.jpeg" | relative_url }}">
